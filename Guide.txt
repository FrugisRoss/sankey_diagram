Hi,
This guide is here to help you launching the tool. You'll see it's very easy.
For now, the tool only allows to plot the sankey diagram for one country and one year but I will work on that soon.

First step : changing the path to the optiflow and balmorel results file, also the path and the name of the csv options file
You just need to change those lines at the beginning of the script :

results_path = 'C:/Users/theod/Documents/Documents importants/DTU/Job/Balmorel/Balmorel + Optiflow/20230914 Balmorel model/01 Balmorel model/base/model/'
results_file_opti = 'Optiflow_MainResults_DK_WP' + '.gdx'
results_file_bal = 'MainResults_DK_WP' + '.gdx'
csv_path = 'C:/Users/theod/Documents/Documents importants/DTU/Job/Balmorel/Balmorel + Optiflow/'
csv_file = 'Sankey_Diagram_Options.csv'

Second step : Go to the end of the document, decide which sector you want to plot by modifying the Options_plot list and decide which country and which year you need, then launch the file :

Options_plot = ['Fuel', 'Elec', 'DH']
Plotting_oneyear_onecountry(csv_file, 'DENMARK', '2050', Options_plot)
